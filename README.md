# Dock helpers

Some tiny tools two make life with macOS’s Dock easier.

## 1 dockzwer

`dockzwer` — Add spacer tiles to the Dock to group its icons.

Without options, a spacer tile is placed on Dock’s Applications side which is as wide as the other icons.  

Use option…
- `-d` to place the spacer on Dock’s Documents side instead.
- `-s` to use a half-width small spacer tile instead.
- `-l` to run `docklockle` afterwards.
- `-h` to print help.

## 2 docklockle

`docklockle` — Toggle Dock’s contents locked/unlocked.
