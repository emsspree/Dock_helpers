# Dock helpers

Some tiny tools two make life with macOS’s Dock easier. 

----

## 1

`dockzwer` — Add spacer tiles to the Dock to devide its icons into groups.

Without options, a spacer is placed on Dock’s Applications side.  
Use option `-d` to place the spacer on Dock’s Documents side.

Without options, the spacer will have the same size as other icons in the Dock.  
Use option `-s` to place a spacer with half the width.

Option `-l`  will let run `docklockle` afterwards.

Option `-h` prints help.

## 2

`docklockle` — Toggle Dock’s contents locked/unlocked.
