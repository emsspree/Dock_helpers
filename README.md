# Dock helpers

Shell programms to make life easier.

## 1. Group Items of Dock

`dockzwer` — Add spacer tiles to the Dock to group the icons.

Without options a spacer tile is placed on Dock’s Applications side. It is as wide as the other icons.

Use option…
- `-d` to place the spacer on Dock’s Documents side instead.
- `-s` to use a half-width small spacer tile instead.
- `-h` to print help.

## 2. Make Dock Contents (Im)mutable

`docklockle` — Toggle Dock locked and unlocked.

Contents are mutable by default. Items can be added, moved or removed.

Use this helper once to disable this.  
Use this helper again to re-enable this.

No options.
