# Dock helpers

Some tiny tools two make life with macOS’s Dock easier. 

----

## 1

`dockzwer` — Add spacer tiles to the Dock to group its icons.

Without options, a spacer is placed on Dock’s Applications side and will have the same size as other icons in the Dock.  

Use option…
- `-d` to place the spacer on Dock’s Documents side.
- `-s` to place a half-width small spacer tile.
- `-l` to let run `docklockle` afterwards.
- `-h` to print help.

## 2

`docklockle` — Toggle Dock’s contents locked/unlocked.
